Jason Kidd fined $15,000 for criticizing officiating

Bucks’ coach Jason Kidd knew this was coming.

After his team lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers 124-119 Tuesday, Kidd said “I just got fined” after pointing out that in the previous three games combined opponents had shot 55 more free throws than his Bucks (95-40). Kidd said, “The different crews that we’ve had have been awful.”

Thursday Kidd got what he expected, the league fined him $15,000 for public criticism of the officiating.

There have been a lot of stars frustrated with calls this season. Kevin Pelton at ESPN did the math and James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and others have seen their percentage of fouls per shot attempt go down — guys are not getting the superstar treatment from referees quite the same way this season. Giannis Antetokounmpo is in that mix as well. It’s going to be an adjustment for players. And coaches.

Maybe Kidd will get his point across with the comment and fines. He seems to feel it was worth it.
