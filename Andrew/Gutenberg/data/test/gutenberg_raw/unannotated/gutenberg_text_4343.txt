 "You will soon," said the other, and abruptly bent downward one
 iron handle of his huge machine.  The engine stopped, stooped, and
 dived almost as deliberately as a man bathing; in their downward
 rush they swept within fifty yards of a big bulk of stone that
 Turnbull knew only too well.  The last red anger of the sunset was
 ended; the dome of heaven was dark; the lanes of flaring light in
 the streets below hardly lit up the base of the building.  But he
 saw that it was St. Paul's Cathedral, and he saw that on the top
 of it the ball was still standing erect, but the cross was
 stricken and had fallen sideways.  Then only he cared to look down
 into the streets, and saw that they were inflamed with uproar and
 tossing passions.

 "We arrive at a happy moment," said the man steering the ship.
 "The insurgents are bombarding the city, and a cannon-ball has
 just hit the cross.  Many of the insurgents are simple people, and
 they naturally regard it as a happy omen."

 "Quite so," said Turnbull, in a rather colourless voice.

 "Yes," replied the other.  "I thought you would be glad to see
 your prayer answered.  Of course I apologize for the word prayer."
