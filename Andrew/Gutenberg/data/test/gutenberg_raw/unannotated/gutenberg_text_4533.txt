 "Is it really true," asked Turnbull, "that he has been allowed to
 buy up and control such a lot?  What put the country into such a
 state?"

 Mr. Cumberland Vane laughed outright.  "What put the country into
 such a state?" he asked.  "Why, you did.  When you were fool enough
 to agree to fight MacIan, after all, everybody was ready to
 believe that the Bank of England might paint itself pink with
 white spots."

 "I don't understand," answered Turnbull.  "Why should you be
 surprised at my fighting?  I hope I have always fought."

 "Well," said Cumberland Vane, airily, "you didn't believe in
 religion, you see--so we thought you were safe at any rate.  You
 went further in your language than most of us wanted to go; no
 good in just hurting one's mother's feelings, I think.  But of
 course we all knew you were right, and, really, we relied on
 you."
