 And yet his whole emotional anger fell from him when he saw
 Turnbull's face, in which the eyes seemed to be bursting from the
 head like bullets.  All the fire and fragrance even of young and
 honourable love faded for a moment before that stiff agony of
 interrogation.

 "Are you hurt, Turnbull?" he asked, anxiously.

 "I am dying," answered the other quite calmly.  "I am in the quite
 literal sense of the words dying to know something.  I want to
 know what all this can possibly mean."

 MacIan did not answer, and he continued with asperity: "You are
 still thinking about that girl, but I tell you the whole thing is
 incredible.  She's not the only person here.  I've met the fellow
 Wilkinson, whose yacht we lost.  I've met the very magistrate you
 were hauled up to when you broke my window.  What can it
 mean--meeting all these old people again?  One never meets such
 old friends again except in a dream."
