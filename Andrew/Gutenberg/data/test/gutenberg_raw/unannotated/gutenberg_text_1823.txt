 "How much I am obliged to you," said he, "for telling me to come to-day!--
 If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the
 happiness of this party.  I had quite determined to go away again."

 "Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about,
 except that you were too late for the best strawberries.
 I was a kinder friend than you deserved.  But you were humble.
 You begged hard to be commanded to come."

 "Don't say I was cross.  I was fatigued.  The heat overcame me."

 "It is hotter to-day."
