 "That's right, my dear, very right.  I had not thought of it before,
 but that is the best way.  They must not over-salt the leg; and then,
 if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled,
 just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a
 boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider
 it unwholesome."
