 "We must bolt, MacIan," he said abruptly.  "And there isn't a
 damned second to lose either.  Do as I do."

 With a bound he was beside the little cluster of his clothes and
 boots that lay on the lawn; he snatched them up, without waiting
 to put any of them on; and tucking his sword under his other arm,
 went wildly at the wall at the bottom of the garden and swung
 himself over it.  Three seconds after he had alighted in his socks
 on the other side, MacIan alighted beside him, also in his socks
 and also carrying clothes and sword in a desperate bundle.

 They were in a by-street, very lean and lonely itself, but so
 close to a crowded thoroughfare that they could see the vague
 masses of vehicles going by, and could even see an individual
 hansom cab passing the corner at the instant.  Turnbull put his
 fingers to his mouth like a gutter-snipe and whistled twice.  Even
 as he did so he could hear the loud voices of the neighbours and
 the police coming down the garden.

 The hansom swung sharply and came tearing down the little lane at
 his call.  When the cabman saw his fares, however, two wild-haired
 men in their shirts and socks with naked swords under their arms,
 he not unnaturally brought his readiness to a rigid stop and
 stared suspiciously.
