 Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's
 dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston
 was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse,
 to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.

 He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with
 a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed
 of what he had done.  He had no reason to wish his hair longer,
 to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent,
 to improve his spirits.  He was quite as undaunted and as lively
 as ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:--

 "I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things
 do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an
 impudent way.  Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not
 always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it.
 Mr. Knightley, he is _not_ a trifling, silly young man.  If he were,
 he would have done this differently.  He would either have gloried
 in the achievement, or been ashamed of it.  There would have been
 either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too
 weak to defend its own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he
 is not trifling or silly."

 With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again,
 and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners,
 and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself;
 of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness
 into her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those
 might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time.
