 Evidently the man in buttons did not feel like a god, so Michael
 made no attempt to explain his feelings to him, but followed him
 meekly enough down the trail of the serpentine staircase.  He had
 no notion where or at what level he was.  He was still full of the
 cold splendour of space, and of what a French writer has
 brilliantly named the "vertigo of the infinite," when another
 door opened, and with a shock indescribable he found himself on
 the familiar level, in a street full of faces, with the houses
 and even the lamp-posts above his head.  He felt suddenly happy
 and suddenly indescribably small.  He fancied he had been changed
 into a child again; his eyes sought the pavement seriously as
 children's do, as if it were a thing with which something
 satisfactory could be done.  He felt the full warmth of that
 pleasure from which the proud shut themselves out; the pleasure
 which not only goes with humiliation, but which almost is
 humiliation.  Men who have escaped death by a hair have it, and
 men whose love is returned by a woman unexpectedly, and men whose
 sins are forgiven them.  Everything his eye fell on it feasted on,
 not aesthetically, but with a plain, jolly appetite as of a boy
 eating buns.  He relished the squareness of the houses; he liked
 their clean angles as if he had just cut them with a knife.  The
 lit squares of the shop windows excited him as the young are
 excited by the lit stage of some promising pantomime.  He
 happened to see in one shop which projected with a bulging
 bravery on to the pavement some square tins of potted meat, and
 it seemed like a hint of a hundred hilarious high teas in a
 hundred streets of the world.  He was, perhaps, the happiest of
 all the children of men.  For in that unendurable instant when he
 hung, half slipping, to the ball of St. Paul's, the whole
 universe had been destroyed and re-created.

 Suddenly through all the din of the dark streets came a crash of
 glass.  With that mysterious suddenness of the Cockney mob, a rush
 was made in the right direction, a dingy office, next to the shop
 of the potted meat.  The pane of glass was lying in splinters
 about the pavement.  And the police already had their hands on a
 very tall young man, with dark, lank hair and dark, dazed eyes,
 with a grey plaid over his shoulder, who had just smashed the
 shop window with a single blow of his stick.

 "I'd do it again," said the young man, with a furious white face.
 "Anybody would have done it.  Did you see what it said?  I swear
 I'd do it again."  Then his eyes encountered the monkish habit of
 Michael, and he pulled off his grey tam-o'-shanter with the
 gesture of a Catholic.

 "Father, did you see what they said?" he cried, trembling.  "Did
 you see what they dared to say?  I didn't understand it at first.
 I read it half through before I broke the window."
