 "Oh, you can see my certificate if you like," she replied with
 some hauteur.

 MacIan stared at her and then at his boots, and then at the sky
 and then at her again.  He was quite sure now that he himself was
 not mad, and the fact rather added to his perplexity.

 Then he drew nearer to her, and said in a dry and dreadful voice:
 "Oh, don't condescend to play the fool with such a fool as me.
 Are you really locked up here as a patient--because you helped us
 to escape?"
