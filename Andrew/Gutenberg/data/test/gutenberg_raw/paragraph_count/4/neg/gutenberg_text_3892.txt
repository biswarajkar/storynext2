 Bent by necessity to his labour, MacIan managed the heavy boat
 with real power and skill, and when at length he ran it up on a
 smoother part of the slope it caught and held so that they could
 clamber out, not sinking farther than their knees into the water
 and the shingle.  A foot or two farther up their feet found the
 beach firmer, and a few moments afterwards they were leaning on
 the ragged breakwater and looking back at the sea they had
 escaped.

 They had a dreary walk across wastes of grey shingle in the grey
 dawn before they began to come within hail of human fields or
 roads; nor had they any notion of what fields or roads they would
 be.  Their boots were beginning to break up and the confusion of
 stones tried them severely, so that they were glad to lean on
 their swords, as if they were the staves of pilgrims. MacIan
 thought vaguely of a weird ballad of his own country which
 describes the soul in Purgatory as walking on a plain full of
 sharp stones, and only saved by its own charities upon earth.

 If ever thou gavest hosen and shoon
 Every night and all,
 Sit thee down and put them on,
 And Christ receive thy soul.

 Turnbull had no such lyrical meditations, but he was in an even
 worse temper.
