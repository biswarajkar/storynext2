 "With all my heart.  I am really tired of exploring so long
 on one spot.  Come, Jane, take my other arm."

 Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.
 "Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out
 of hearing:--"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as
 they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only
 knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!  Peculiarly lucky!--
 for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath,
 or any public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be
 no knowledge.  It is only by seeing women in their own homes,
 among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form
 any just judgment.  Short of that, it is all guess and luck--
 and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself
 on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!"

 Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her
 own confederates, spoke now.

 "Such things do occur, undoubtedly."--She was stopped by a cough.
 Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.
