 "Jerusalem!" said Turnbull, laughing.  "Well, we've taken the only
 inhabitant into captivity."

 And he picked up his sword and made it whistle like a boy's wand.

 "I beg your pardon," said MacIan, dryly.  "Let us begin."

 MacIan made a military salute with his weapon, which Turnbull
 copied or parodied with an impatient contempt; and in the
 stillness of the garden the swords came together with a clear
 sound like a bell.  The instant the blades touched, each felt them
 tingle to their very points with a personal vitality, as if they
 were two naked nerves of steel.  Evan had worn throughout an air
 of apathy, which might have been the stale apathy of one who
 wants nothing.  But it was indeed the more dreadful apathy of one
 who wants something and will care for nothing else.  And this was
 seen suddenly; for the instant Evan engaged he disengaged and
 lunged with an infernal violence.  His opponent with a desperate
 promptitude parried and riposted; the parry only just succeeded,
 the riposte failed.  Something big and unbearable seemed to have
 broken finally out of Evan in that first murderous lunge, leaving
 him lighter and cooler and quicker upon his feet.  He fell to
 again, fiercely still, but now with a fierce caution.  The next
 moment Turnbull lunged; MacIan seemed to catch the point and
 throw it away from him, and was thrusting back like a
 thunderbolt, when a sound paralysed him; another sound beside
 their ringing weapons.  Turnbull, perhaps from an equal
 astonishment, perhaps from chivalry, stopped also and forebore to
 send his sword through his exposed enemy.
