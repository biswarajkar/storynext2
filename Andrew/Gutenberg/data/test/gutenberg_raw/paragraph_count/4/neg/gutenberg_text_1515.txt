 MacIan, with singed hair, smoking garments, and smarting hands
 and face, had already broken far enough through the first
 barriers of burning timber to come within cry of the cells he had
 once known.  It was impossible, however, to see the spot where the
 old man lay dead or alive; not now through darkness, but through
 scorching and aching light.  The site of the old half-wit's cell
 was now the heart of a standing forest of fire--the flames as
 thick and yellow as a cornfield.  Their incessant shrieking and
 crackling was like a mob shouting against an orator.  Yet through
 all that deafening density MacIan thought he heard a small and
 separate sound.  When he heard it he rushed forward as if to
 plunge into that furnace, but Turnbull arrested him by an elbow.

 "Let me go!" cried Evan, in agony; "it's the poor old beggar's
 voice--he's still alive, and shouting for help."

 "Listen!" said Turnbull, and lifted one finger from his clenched
 hand.

 "Or else he is shrieking with pain," protested MacIan.  "I will
 not endure it."
