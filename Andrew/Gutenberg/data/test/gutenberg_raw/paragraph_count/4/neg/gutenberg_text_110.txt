 "I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been
 repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,
 that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.
 At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,
 well bred men.  I should be surprized if, after seeing them,
 you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving
 him to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at
 yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before.
 Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure
 you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,
 and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated
 as I stood here."

 "Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.  He has not such a fine
 air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.  I see the difference
 plain enough.  But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"

 "Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair
 to compare Mr. Martin with _him_.  You might not see one in a hundred
 with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley.  But he is
 not the only gentleman you have been lately used to.  What say you
 to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_.
 Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking;
 of being silent.  You must see the difference."

 "Oh yes!--there is a great difference.  But Mr. Weston is almost
 an old man.  Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."
