 The young man with the round face looked down for a little while
 and smoked reflectively.  The other and elder doctor had gone
 pacing nervously by himself upon the lawn.  At length the round
 face was lifted again, and showed two round blue eyes with a
 certain frankness in them.

 "Well, I don't see that it can do any harm to tell you know," he
 said.  "You were shut up just then because it was just during that
 month that the Master was bringing off his big scheme.  He was
 getting his bill through Parliament, and organizing the new
 medical police.  But of course you haven't heard of all that; in
 fact, you weren't meant to."

 "Heard of all what?" asked the impatient inquirer.

 "There's a new law now, and the asylum powers are greatly
 extended.  Even if you did escape now, any policeman would take
 you up in the next town if you couldn't show a certificate of
 sanity from us."
