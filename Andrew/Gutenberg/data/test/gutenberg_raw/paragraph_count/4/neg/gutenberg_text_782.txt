 "There will be another mass in a matter of eight hours," said
 Madeleine, with a sort of business eagerness and energy, "and you
 can do it then before the fighting.  You must forgive me, but I
 was so frightened that you would not do it at all."

 Bert seemed to crush his teeth together until they broke, and
 managed to say between them: "And why should you suppose that I
 shouldn't do as you say--I mean not to do it at all?"

 "You always go to Mass," answered the girl, opening her wide blue
 eyes, "and the Mass is very long and tiresome unless one loves
 God."

 Then it was that Bert exploded with a brutality which might have
 come from Count Gregory, his criminal opponent.  He advanced upon
 Madeleine with flaming eyes, and almost took her by the two
 shoulders.  "I do not love God," he cried, speaking French with
 the broadest Scotch accent; "I do not want to find Him; I do not
 think He is there to be found.  I must burst up the show; I must
 and will say everything.  You are the happiest and honestest thing
 I ever saw in this godless universe.  And I am the dirtiest and
 most dishonest."
