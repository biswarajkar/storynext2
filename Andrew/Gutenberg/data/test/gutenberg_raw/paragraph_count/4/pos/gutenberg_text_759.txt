 But the real interest arose suddenly as a squall arises with the
 extraordinary affair that occurred about five days after.  There
 was about a third of a mile beyond the village of Haroc a large
 but lonely hotel upon the London or Paris model, but commonly
 almost entirely empty.  Among the accidental group of guests who
 had come to it at this season was a man whose nationality no one
 could fix and who bore the non-committal name of Count Gregory.
 He treated everybody with complete civility and almost in
 complete silence.  On the few occasions when he spoke, he spoke
 either French, English, or once (to the priest) Latin; and the
 general opinion was that he spoke them all wrong.  He was a large,
 lean man, with the stoop of an aged eagle, and even the eagle's
 nose to complete it; he had old-fashioned military whiskers and
 moustache dyed with a garish and highly incredible yellow.  He had
 the dress of a showy gentleman and the manners of a decayed
 gentleman; he seemed (as with a sort of simplicity) to be trying
 to be a dandy when he was too old even to know that he was old.
 Ye he was decidedly a handsome figure with his curled yellow hair
 and lean fastidious face; and he wore a peculiar frock-coat of
 bright turquoise blue, with an unknown order pinned to it, and he
 carried a huge and heavy cane.  Despite his silence and his
 dandified dress and whiskers, the island might never have heard
 of him but for the extraordinary event of which I have spoken,
 which fell about in the following way:

 In such casual atmospheres only the enthusiastic go to
 Benediction; and as the warm blue twilight closed over the little
 candle-lit church and village, the line of worshippers who went
 home from the former to the latter thinned out until it broke.  On
 one such evening at least no one was in church except the quiet,
 unconquerable Madeleine, four old women, one fisherman, and, of
 course, the irrepressible M. Camille Bert.  The others seemed to
 melt away afterwards into the peacock colours of the dim green
 grass and the dark blue sky.  Even Durand was invisible instead of
 being merely reverentially remote; and Madeleine set forth
 through the patch of black forest alone.  She was not in the least
 afraid of loneliness, because she was not afraid of devils.  I
 think they were afraid of her.

 In a clearing of the wood, however, which was lit up with a last
 patch of the perishing sunlight, there advanced upon her suddenly
 one who was more startling than a devil.  The incomprehensible
 Count Gregory, with his yellow hair like flame and his face like
 the white ashes of the flame, was advancing bareheaded towards
 her, flinging out his arms and his long fingers with a frantic
 gesture.

 "We are alone here," he cried, "and you would be at my mercy,
 only that I am at yours."
