 "They are all very beautiful," said Evan, as if in doubt.

 "They are all beautiful," answered the other, "because each is in
 his place and owns his superior.  And now England will be
 beautiful after the same fashion.  The earth will be as beautiful
 as the heavens, because our kings have come back to us."

 "The Stuart----" began Evan, earnestly.

 "Yes," answered the old man, "that which has returned is Stuart
 and yet older than Stuart.  It is Capet and Plantagenet and
 Pendragon.  It is all that good old time of which proverbs tell,
 that golden reign of Saturn against which gods and men were
 rebels.  It is all that was ever lost by insolence and overwhelmed
 in rebellion.  It is your own forefather, MacIan with the broken
 sword, bleeding without hope at Culloden.  It is Charles refusing
 to answer the questions of the rebel court.  It is Mary of the
 magic face confronting the gloomy and grasping peers and the
 boorish moralities of Knox.  It is Richard, the last Plantagenet,
 giving his crown to Bolingbroke as to a common brigand.  It is
 Arthur, overwhelmed in Lyonesse by heathen armies and dying in
 the mist, doubtful if ever he shall return."
