 After another half mile that seemed a mere flash, Turnbull leant
 over and locked the door.  Evan staggered at last into his seat
 and hid his throbbing head in his hands; and still the car flew
 on and its driver sat inflexible and silent.  The moon had already
 gone down, and the whole darkness was faintly troubled with
 twilight and the first movement of beasts and fowls.  It was that
 mysterious moment when light is coming as if it were something
 unknown whose nature one could not guess--a mere alteration in
 everything.  They looked at the sky and it seemed as dark as ever;
 then they saw the black shape of a tower or tree against it and
 knew that it was already grey.  Save that they were driving
 southward and had certainly passed the longitude of London, they
 knew nothing of their direction; but Turnbull, who had spent a
 year on the Hampshire coast in his youth, began to recognize the
 unmistakable but quite indescribable villages of the English
 south.  Then a white witch fire began to burn between the black
 stems of the fir-trees; and, like so many things in nature,
 though not in books on evolution, the daybreak, when it did come,
 came much quicker than one would think.  The gloomy heavens were
 ripped up and rolled away like a scroll, revealing splendours, as
 the car went roaring up the curve of a great hill; and above them
 and black against the broadening light, there stood one of those
 crouching and fantastic trees that are first signals of the sea.

 As they came over the hill and down on the other side of it, it
 is not too much to say that the whole universe of God opened over
 them and under them, like a thing unfolding to five times its
 size.  Almost under their feet opened the enormous sea, at the
 bottom of a steep valley which fell down into a bay; and the sea
 under their feet blazed at them almost as lustrous and almost as
 empty as the sky.  The sunrise opened above them like some cosmic
 explosion, shining and shattering and yet silent; as if the world
 were blown to pieces without a sound.  Round the rays of the
 victorious sun swept a sort of rainbow of confused and conquered
 colours--brown and blue and green and flaming rose-colour; as
 though gold were driving before it all the colours of the world.
 The lines of the landscape down which they sped, were the simple,
 strict, yet swerving, lines of a rushing river; so that it was
 almost as if they were being sucked down in a huge still
 whirlpool.  Turnbull had some such feeling, for he spoke for the
 first time for many hours.

 "If we go down at this rate we shall be over the sea cliff," he
 said.
