 "I am quite easy on that head," replied Mrs. Weston.  "I am
 very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,
 which both might not have heard."

 "You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear,
 when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady."

 "True.  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss
 Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her;
 and as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe."

 At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,
 evidently on the watch.  His wife gave him a look which invited
 him in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now, dearest Emma,
 let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his
 heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.
 Let us make the best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may
 be fairly said in her favour.  It is not a connexion to gratify;
 but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it
 may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,
 that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness
 of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--
 and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this
 one great deviation from the strict rule of right.  And how much
 may be said in her situation for even that error!"
