 "So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!  So seldom
 that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing
 about the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million,
 I suppose, actually lost!  And when one considers the variety
 of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered,
 it increases the wonder."

 "The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some
 quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them.  If you
 want any farther explanation," continued he, smiling, "they are
 paid for it.  That is the key to a great deal of capacity.
 The public pays and must be served well."

 The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual
 observations made.

 "I have heard it asserted," said John Knightley, "that the same
 sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the
 same master teaches, it is natural enough.  But for that reason,
 I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females,
 for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble
 into any hand they can get.  Isabella and Emma, I think, do write
 very much alike.  I have not always known their writing apart."
