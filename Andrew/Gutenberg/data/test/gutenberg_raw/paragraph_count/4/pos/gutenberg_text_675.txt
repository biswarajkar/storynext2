 As he spoke, three solemn footmen came out of the lodge gate and
 assembled to assist the chauffeur to his room.  The mere sight of
 them made the two wanderers flee as from a too frightful
 incongruity, and before they knew where they were, they were well
 upon the grassy ledge of England that overlooks the Channel.  Evan
 said suddenly: "Will they let me see her in heaven once in a
 thousand ages?" and addressed the remark to the editor of _The
 Atheist_, as on which he would be likely or qualified to answer.
 But no answer came; a silence sank between the two.

 Turnbull strode sturdily to the edge of the cliff and looked out,
 his companion following, somewhat more shaken by his recent
 agitation.

 "If that's the view you take," said Turnbull, "and I don't say
 you are wrong, I think I know where we shall be best off for the
 business.  As it happens, I know this part of the south coast
 pretty well.  And unless I am mistaken there's a way down the
 cliff just here which will land us on a stretch of firm sand
 where no one is likely to follow us."

 The Highlander made a gesture of assent and came also almost to
 the edge of the precipice.  The sunrise, which was broadening over
 sea and shore, was one of those rare and splendid ones in which
 there seems to be no mist or doubt, and nothing but a universal
 clarification more and more complete.  All the colours were
 transparent.  It seemed like a triumphant prophecy of some perfect
 world where everything being innocent will be intelligible; a
 world where even our bodies, so to speak, may be as of burning
 glass.  Such a world is faintly though fiercely figured in the
 coloured windows of Christian architecture.  The sea that lay
 before them was like a pavement of emerald, bright and almost
 brittle; the sky against which its strict horizon hung was almost
 absolutely white, except that close to the sky line, like scarlet
 braids on the hem of a garment, lay strings of flaky cloud of so
 gleaming and gorgeous a red that they seemed cut out of some
 strange blood-red celestial metal, of which the mere gold of this
 earth is but a drab yellow imitation.
