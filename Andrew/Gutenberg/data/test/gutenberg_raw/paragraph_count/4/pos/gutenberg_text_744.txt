 "Not France?" repeated Turnbull, with a sort of dull incredulity.

 "No, sir," said the sergeant; "though most of the people talk
 French.  This is the island called St. Loup, sir, an island in the
 Channel.  We've been sent down specially from London, as you were
 such specially distinguished criminals, if you'll allow me to say
 so.  Which reminds me to warn you that anything you say may be
 used against you at your trial."

 "Quite so," said Turnbull, and lurched suddenly against the
 sergeant, so as to tip him over the edge of the road with a crash
 into the shingle below.  Then leaving MacIan and the policemen
 equally and instantaneously nailed to the road, he ran a little
 way along it, leapt off on to a part of the beach, which he had
 found in his journey to be firmer, and went across it with a
 clatter of pebbles.  His sudden calculation was successful; the
 police, unacquainted with the various levels of the loose beach,
 tried to overtake him by the shorter cut and found themselves,
 being heavy men, almost up to their knees in shoals of slippery
 shingle.  Two who had been slower with their bodies were quicker
 with their minds, and seeing Turnbull's trick, ran along the edge
 of the road after him.  Then MacIan finally awoke, and leaving
 half his sleeve in the grip of the only man who tried to hold
 him, took the two policemen in the small of their backs with the
 impetus of a cannon-ball and, sending them also flat among the
 stones, went tearing after his twin defier of the law.

 As they were both good runners, the start they had gained was
 decisive.  They dropped over a high breakwater farther on upon the
 beach, turned sharply, and scrambled up a line of ribbed rocks,
 crowned with a thicket, crawled through it, scratching their
 hands and faces, and dropped into another road; and there found
 that they could slacken their speed into a steady trot.  In all
 this desperate dart and scramble, they still kept hold of their
 drawn swords, which now, indeed, in the vigorous phrase of
 Bunyan, seemed almost to grow out of their hands.
