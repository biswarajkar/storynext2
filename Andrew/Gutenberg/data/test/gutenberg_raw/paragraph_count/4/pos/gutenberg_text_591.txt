 The lady in long gloves and the fur cap leapt out and ran rapidly
 towards them, only to be reassured by Turnbull, who (unlike many
 of his school) really knew a little science when he invoked it to
 redeem the world.  "He's all right," said he; "he's quite safe.
 But I'm afraid he won't be able to drive the car for half an hour
 or so."

 "I can drive the car," said the young woman in the fur cap with
 stony practicability.

 "Oh, in that case," began MacIan, uneasily; and that paralysing
 shyness which is a part of romance induced him to make a backward
 movement as if leaving her to herself.  But Turnbull was more
 rational than he, being more indifferent.

 "I don't think you ought to drive home alone, ma'am," he said,
 gruffly.  "There seem to be a lot of rowdy parties along this
 road, and the man will be no use for an hour.  If you will tell
 us where you are going, we will see you safely there and say good
 night."
