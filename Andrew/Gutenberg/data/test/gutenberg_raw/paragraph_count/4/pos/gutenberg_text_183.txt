 MacIan leant his white and rather weary face back upon the
 cushions in order to speak up through the open door.

 "Mr. Turnbull," he said, "I have nothing to add to what I have
 said before.  It is strongly borne in upon me that you and I, the
 sole occupants of this runaway cab, are at this moment the two
 most important people in London, possibly in Europe.  I have been
 looking at all the streets as we went past, I have been looking
 at all the shops as we went past, I have been looking at all the
 churches as we went past.  At first, I felt a little dazed with
 the vastness of it all.  I could not understand what it all meant.
 But now I know exactly what it all means.  It means us.  This whole
 civilization is only a dream.  You and I are the realities."

 "Religious symbolism," said Mr. Turnbull, through the trap, "does
 not, as you are probably aware, appeal ordinarily to thinkers of
 the school to which I belong.  But in symbolism as you use it in
 this instance, I must, I think, concede a certain truth.  We
 _must_ fight this thing out somewhere; because, as you truly say,
 we have found each other's reality.  We _must_ kill each other--or
 convert each other.  I used to think all Christians were
 hypocrites, and I felt quite mildly towards them really.  But I
 know you are sincere--and my soul is mad against you.  In the same
 way you used, I suppose, to think that all atheists thought
 atheism would leave them free for immorality--and yet in your
 heart you tolerated them entirely.  Now you _know_ that I am an
 honest man, and you are mad against me, as I am against you.  Yes,
 that's it.  You can't be angry with bad men.  But a good man in the
 wrong--why one thirsts for his blood.  Yes, you open for me a
 vista of thought."

 "Don't run into anything," said Evan, immovably.
