 "Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;
 and she came in his way."

 "I dare say," returned Harriet, sighing again, "I dare say she
 was very much attached to him."

 "Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the
 woman who loves him best.  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,
 and thought this the best offer she was likely to have."

 "Yes," said Harriet earnestly, "and well she might, nobody could ever
 have a better.  Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.  And now,
 Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.
 He is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know,
 it is quite a different thing.  No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need
 not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery.
 To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--
 She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves.
 Happy creature!  He called her `Augusta.'  How delightful!"
