Detroit Lions lost confidence in Ameer Abdullah after fumble troubles

The Detroit Lions lost confidence in Ameer Abdullah after his second fumble against the Green Bay Packers, but offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter expects the team’s starting running back to return to form soon.

“We don’t ever want to turn the ball over,” Cooter said Thursday. “We don’t want to ever expose the ball to the defense. Didn’t have his best day, but he’s a guy that’s been really somebody we’ve trusted around here to handle himself the right way, to do things the right way, to protect the ball the right way.

“I think moving forward, we’ll gain that confidence level right back to where it’s always been. When you have a game that’s not quite living up to what you would like it to as a player, sometimes you got to just throw that thing away, fix the problem, and move forward. And I think he’ll do that. Ameer’s the right kind of guy, he works really hard. I don’t foresee any change.”

The fumbles were the first of the season for Abdullah, and they weren’t costly in a 30-17 win. But they could have been, and Abdullah was benched after he fumbled on consecutive drives late in the game.

Abdullah’s first fumble came when the Lions led, 17-3, late in the third quarter. They started the drive with a short field and could have slammed the door closed, but Abdullah’s fumble on Green Bay’s 27 was recovered by Randall Cobb.

On the next drive, early in the fourth quarter, the Lions had marched from their 36 and had first-and-goal at the Packers’ 1 when Abdullah fumbled. Right tackle Rick Wagner recovered and the Lions kicked a short field goal for a 20-3 lead.It wasn’t a good showing overall for Abdullah, who has been subtly hinting at wanting an expanded role on offense. He averaged 2.3 yards with one touchdown on 21 carries and caught one pass for nine yards.

As for Abdullah’s own confidence level, he said it hadn’t changed because of one game and he didn’t feel the need to earn his coaches’ trust.

“It’s been in game all year,” he said. “Nah, it happens. Got to be better in there, but it’s not an area of concern.”

Abdullah said he wanted to be better with his ball security and more productive on his runs. But overall he was pleased with his performance, including his reads and pass protection, and would not change his approach.

As for the fumbles on consecutive drives, Abdullah chalked those up to a strange coincidence.

“Just a turn of events that happens sometimes,” he said. “You would understand it more if you played the game. But from the outside perspective it seems like, ‘What’s happening?’ It’s like, nah, man, things just happen. It’s how you come back and continue to grow from it. It’s not the world’s ending. We’ve got eight games left.”
