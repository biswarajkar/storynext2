 "No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged
 to you for reminding me.  I should be extremely sorry to be giving
 them any pain.  I know what worthy people they are.  Perry tells
 me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor.  You would not think
 it to look at him, but he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious.
 No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain.  My dear Emma,
 we must consider this.  I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting
 Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.
 You will not regard being tired.  You will be perfectly safe,
 you know, among your friends."
