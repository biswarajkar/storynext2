A yob who drunkenly punched a Metrolink ticket inspector and hurled vile racist abuse at another has walked free from court.
Paul Smith, 46, also swung a belt around during the violent outburst in the city centre which left passengers ‘terrified.’
Smith, from Chorlton, was so drunk he cannot remember what happened, the judge was told.
He was on a busy tram travelling through Manchester towards Victoria station when he became aggressive to a group of fellow passengers.
The driver stopped at St Peter’s Square and ordered Smith to get off but he initially refused, Eileen Rogers, prosecuting said.
A group of around 10 inspectors, including Phil Burke and Aaron Iman, who were on a tram heading back from the Etihad Stadium, managed to get him out.

However he carried on being abusive and aggressive on the platform, shouting ‘I f*****g hate Europeans’.
He then tried to get back on the tram and when Mr Burke tried to stop him, he tried to punch the tram window but also made contact with Mr Burke’s face, hitting him on the eye, causing swelling, the court was told.
He also took his belt off and ‘began waving it around’ and shouted a racial slur towards Mr Iman.
Police were called and he was arrested.
The tram, and the network as a whole, were very busy at the time, shortly before 6.30pm on Saturday, October 14.
David Philpott, defending, said Smith was a ‘skilled’ paint technician who has worked for companies including BMW, but is currently unemployed.
He had ‘very little recollection of what took place’ due to how much booze he’d drunk, Mr Philpott told the district judge.

He said Smith, who cares for his elderly father with dementia, had now gone tee-total.
“His behaviour was disgraceful and that is somewhat of an understatement” he said.
“He consumed a large amount of alcohol. He’s now abstinent from alcohol, it’s been several weeks now and he’s adamant he is sticking to this course of action in staying away from alcohol and any other substances.
“So he has taken some prompt action following this particular incident.
“He’s ashamed of his actions.”
Smith, of Darlbeck Walk, Chorlton, admitted assault and a racially aggravated public order offence at an earlier hearing.
District Judge John Temperley, sitting at Manchester Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday, sentenced Smith to eight weeks in prison, suspended for a year, and ordered him to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work.

He must also pay £100 compensation to each victim and £100 in costs and undergo an alcohol treatment programme.
The judge said: “The two victims were both members of staff doing their job, and trying to deal with a very difficult customer and a very difficult situation.
“And it was in the presence of a lot of other members of the public who would no doubt have been upset and distressed by what they witnessed.”
Speaking afterwards, Mr Burke, 48, who’s worked for Metrolink for nearly five years, told the M.E.N: “He had violence on his mind that day. He was out of control and aggressive and it was terrifying for the members of the public who witnessed it.
“There were Diwali celebrations going on in the city that day and his racist remarks were made in earshot of lots of members of the public. We’re there to help people and protect. We’re not there to be punched and abused.”
Beverley Hughes, Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime said: "Racial abuse and violence will not be tolerated in Greater Manchester. Those who commit such crimes including, as in this case, against people just doing their jobs, should be sent the strongest possible message that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable.
"On the face of it, in this case, the sentence handed out comes nowhere near reflecting the seriousness of the crime and my office will be asking the relevant agencies to explain why."
