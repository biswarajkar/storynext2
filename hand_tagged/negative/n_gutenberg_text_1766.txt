 Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all
 to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up
 for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,
 when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered
 whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill,
 with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment
 sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.
 Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--
 The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--
 they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking
 into a chair fainted away.
