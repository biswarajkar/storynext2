The rising numbers have pushed extreme poverty into the open.
Tammy Stephen, 54, on September 26 in Seattle. Stephen lives in Camp Second Chance, a city-sanctioned homeless encampment in Seattle. 'Housing here is out of control. That's why we have so many people on the street,' she said. 'There's nowhere for them to go. Moi Williams, 59, on September 13 in Los Angeles. Williams, who has been homeless for four years, said he is comfortable sleeping on the street. 'I'm not bothering nobody. I'm not being bothered.' The homeless are easy to pass by on the street. It's harder when you look into their eyes. Their gazes hint at lost promise or a glimmer of hope. Some are sad, some placid, others haunting.

Alicia Adara, 33, on September 27 in Seattle. Adara said she ended up on the street after losing a custody fight for her two children with her ex-husband. 'I don't do shelters. I feel like I'm in jail,' she said. 'I've been like basically a prisoner all my life. I need to do this. I need to be out here. It's freedom.' James Harris, 54, on October 3 in Los Angeles. Harris has had AIDS for 30 years, he said. When medication stopped working, he got depressed and was evicted. Now he feels like an outcast, vulnerable and struggling to survive. He's hoping that as a veteran he can get permanent housing, though he missed an earlier opportunity because a stint in a shelter disqualified him from being considered chronically homeless
