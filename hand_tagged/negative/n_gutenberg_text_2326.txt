 She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every
 blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings
 of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.
 The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,
 poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a
 distance from.  She would be a loser in every way.  Emma could not
 deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.
 In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;
 but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity
 that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.
