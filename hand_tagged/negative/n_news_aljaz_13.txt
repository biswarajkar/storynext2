Djamel Ameziane wants his dignity back.

The 50-year-old former prisoner says that's why he filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against the Canadian government, alleging it was complicit in his detention and torture at the US-run military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Ameziane was detained without charge or trial at Guantanamo from early 2002 until December 2013, when he was forcibly returned to his native Algeria, despite fears for his safety.

"I want people to know what happened to me, and I want them to know that Canada was partly to blame," Ameziane told Al Jazeera in an email interview.

"I don't think Canada should be involved in torture of anyone else."

A $40-million claim
In a statement of claim filed in the Ontario Superior Court on November 6 and seen by Al Jazeera, Ameziane is seeking damages totalling almost $40m.

Between 1995 and 2000, Ameziane lived in Canada, where he was seeking political asylum after fleeing Algeria during a bloody civil war in the early 1990s.

He alleges that Canadian officials exchanged information with their US counterparts that contributed to his mistreatment at the prison camp.

Ameziane's Canadian lawyer, Nathan Whitling, told Al Jazeera that Ameziane is seeking a public inquiry or a trial to look into Canada's role in what happened.

"We want Canada to be held to account," Whitling said.

"We want their role in this whole process to be brought to light."

A spokesperson for Canada's Department of Public Safety said the government could not comment on Ameziane's case since it is now before the courts.

However, Ottawa issued new directives in September that aim "to avoid complicity in mistreatment or torture by foreign entities" going forward, Scott Bardsley told Al Jazeera in an email.

The directives strengthen the rules overseeing Canada's spy agency (CSIS), its national police force (RCMP) and its border security agency (CBSA). 

"Canada must avoid knowingly contributing to mistreatment by foreign entities," Bardsley said.

The road to Guantanamo
Canadian officials began collecting information about Ameziane and other members of the Muslim community in Montreal in late 1999, the lawsuit alleges, and they shared that information with US intelligence officials.

The information-sharing process began after Ahmed Ressam, another Algerian man living in Montreal at the time, was caught with a stash of explosives in the boot of his car as he crossed the Canada-US border.

In what became known as the "Millenium Plot", Ressam had planned to attack Los Angeles airport and was later sentenced to 37 years in prison.

After his asylum request in Canada was rejected in 2000, Ameziane said he went to Afghanistan because he feared what would happen if he returned to Algeria.

However, when fighting began there in 2001 after the US invasion, he fled to Pakistan.

That is where he was captured by local police and handed over to US forces "in exchange for a bounty," the lawsuit states.

Ameziane says he was then shipped to a US military base in Kandahar; he further claims he was beaten while in custody.

Finally, in February 2002, he was flown - "hooded, shackled and chained to the floor" of a plane "for the duration of his 15-hour journey" - to Guantanamo.
