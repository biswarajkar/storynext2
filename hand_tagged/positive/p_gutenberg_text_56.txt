 Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed,
 as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.
 There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when
 Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and
 Miss Bates returned the visit.  Now was the time for Mr. Frank
 Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was
 understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.
 For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention
 of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.  "I suppose you
 have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written
 to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.
 Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.  Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he
 says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life."
