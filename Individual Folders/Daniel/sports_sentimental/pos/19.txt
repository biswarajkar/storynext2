Arsenal youngster Nketiah scores four times on international duty

Eddie Nketiah may be the next big thing in English soccer.

The Arsenal teenager, who saved Arsenal the Carabao Cup against Norwich City with a brace, scored four goals for England’s Under-19s in a 6-0 win over the Faroe Islands. Nketiah scored dribbling to his right, to his left, from a penalty kick and on the volley from a cross, showcasing his budding talent.

Nketiah has featured twice off the bench for the Gunners on their Europa League campaign and at the age of 18, looks to be the next young star for Arsenal.

Eddie Nketiah (born 30/05/99) is the first player born after Arsène Wenger was appointed Arsenal manager to score for the club.
