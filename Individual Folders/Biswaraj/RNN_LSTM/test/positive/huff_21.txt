Christmas trees are great, but they’re not a small undertaking. Needles everywhere. Daily waterings. Your cat getting involved. That’s why we’re in love with the pineapple Christmas tree, an adorable decor trend that’s popping up just in time for the holidays. Here, some favorites we’ve seen so far.
