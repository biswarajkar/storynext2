I read a lot of comics as a child, mainly those old Disney ones about Donald Duck and his nephews. Also Asterix and Tintin and that stuff. But the first adult graphic work that had a strong impact on me was Richard Appignanesi and Robert Crumb’s book about Kafka. It’s still one of my favourite books in any genre. Later I shared a flat with Richard’s son, Josh, who had a huge collection of Drawn and Quarterly stuff and manga and I read all that. When I first came to America, 18 years ago, I lived for a bit in Greenpoint, in Brooklyn, back when it was a sort of proto-hipster area and there was a little pop-up book store on the corner that specialised in graphic novels and McSweeney’s issues. That’s where I found Chris Ware in pamphlet form, his Jimmy Corrigan in serialisation. Once I’d read Chris I was obsessed. One of my most treasured possessions is a sketch of Corrigan saying “Ha ha … hi Zadie…”, which I forced Chris to draw for me when I spent a day with him in London around 2000.
What do you love about them?
Everything. To me they’re like opera, or musicals – they provide the satisfaction of multiple media in one space. I can just about imagine writing like Chris Ware but to write like Chris and draw like Chris blows my mind.
Do you have a favourite?
Too many. Corrigan, obviously, and all books by Ware, especially Building Stories. Here by Richard McGuire. All of Charles Burns, especially Big Baby. All of Dan Clowes, especially You My Mother?, Alison Bechdel. The Hernandez brothers, Lynda Barry, Tomine… these are all canonical and the list is endless, but of more recent finds, I am blown away by Walter Scott’s Wendy series, and both Beverly and Sabrina by Nick Drnaso seem to me to be masterpieces. Joff Winterhart’s Driving Short Distances is extraordinary and also Everything Is Flammable by Gabrielle Bell. I still like finding things before they become books, but that’s harder to do as a middle-aged lady no longer often in comic stores. But on a visit to Los Feliz I found The Fade Out by Brubaker and Breitweiser in the old serial form, issues 1-5 (but missing 4) and fell in love, even with the gap in the tale.

What do you love about them?
I love staring at drawings anyway. And when juxtaposed with a real story… It’s a lot like what acting aspires to be. An interpretive art. Delivering secret messages.
