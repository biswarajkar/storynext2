We are fully into the swing of summer, so, naturally it’s the perfect time to think about…the holidays? A season known for being filled with joy and festivity, but equally jammed with stress and too many plans. From office holiday parties, to friends and family, it can be a seriously stressful time.

With that in mind, and incredible deals available for those who start planning ahead, why not use your time off work to actually enjoy yourself, and go on holiday for the holidays? Depending on what you’re planning, the sweet spot for booking will vary.

Here are five reasons to think about getting away for the season:
raditions are meant to be shared, learned and updated
Maybe you shy away from the idea of traveling during the holidays because you have traditions with your family and friends. Whether it’s baking cookies for the neighborhood or going caroling, it is totally normal to have something you like to do every year. But that shouldn’t keep you from learning new traditions.

Last year I spent Christmas in Scotland – it was very far from home, certainly a cold place to spend the holidays and unfamiliar territory. I worried that I would feel sad, away from family and away from our traditions. Instead, I learned about Scottish traditions like Christmas crackers (also seen all over the UK and Australia) and dancing the ceilidh.

I experienced Christmas like I never had before – and that was a good thing.

Experiences can be the best gifts
Or the best way to use new gifts. Tinggly lets you purchase experience certificates and the receiver can use them anywhere in the world. But why not go together? Or you might have your eye on a new camera, but where are you going to use it? And whom will you be taking pictures of/with?

On that trip in Scotland, it wasn’t just solo travelers without loved ones, but couples celebrating their first Christmas together, seeing snow for the first time or a few families – parents and children – experiencing a new country together. Being in a different geographic location didn’t take away from their ability to have quality time together. In fact, it eliminated the distractions of their daily lives at home and let them be present in their time as a family.

Put aside the way that Home Alone depicted family holidays. Getting away means leaving the stress of the season behind. Managing everyone’s schedules, picking up gifts, baking cookies, and doing it all while driving in snow and ice. If you aren’t traveling with the McCallisters, it is the perfect way to relax during the season and enjoy the time you have off from work and the kids have off from school.

Sure, travel has its stresses, but is also comes with margaritas. [or mulled wine, or whisky, or whatever your destination’s beverage of choice may be]
