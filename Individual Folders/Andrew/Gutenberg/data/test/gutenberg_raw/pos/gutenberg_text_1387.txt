 It was a sad change.  They had been meeting almost every day
 since his arrival.  Certainly his being at Randalls had given
 great spirit to the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea,
 the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought,
 the assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners!
 It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking
 from it into the common course of Hartfield days.  To complete every
 other recommendation, he had almost told her that he loved her.
 What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to,
 was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having
 a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself;
 and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that
 she must be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous
 determination against it.
