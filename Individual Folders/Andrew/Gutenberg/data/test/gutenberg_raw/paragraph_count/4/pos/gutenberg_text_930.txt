 The man with the good hat and the jumping elbow went by very
 quickly; yet the man with the bad hat, who thought he was God,
 overtook him.  He ran after him and jumped over a bed of geraniums
 to catch him.

 "I beg your Majesty's pardon," he said, with mock humility, "but
 here is a quarrel which you ought really to judge."

 Then as he led the heavy, silk-hatted man back towards the group,
 he caught MacIan's ear in order to whisper: "This poor gentleman
 is mad; he thinks he is Edward VII."  At this the self-appointed
 Creator slightly winked.  "Of course you won't trust him much;
 come to me for everything.  But in my position one has to meet so
 many people.  One has to be broadminded."

 The big banker in the black frock-coat and hat was standing quite
 grave and dignified on the lawn, save for his slight twitch of
 one limb, and he did not seem by any means unworthy of the part
 which the other promptly forced upon him.
