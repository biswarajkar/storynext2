 "Ah, you're a casuist!" said the large man, wagging his head.
 "Now, do you know what I always say to casuists...?"

 MacIan made a violent gesture; and Turnbull broke into open
 laughter.  The peacemaker did not seem to be in the least annoyed,
 but continued in unabated enjoyment.

 "Well, well," he said, "let us get back to the point.  Now Tolstoy
 has shown that force is no remedy; so you see the position in
 which I am placed.  I am doing my best to stop what I'm sure you
 won't mind my calling this really useless violence, this really
 quite wrong violence of yours.  But it's against my principles to
 call in the police against you, because the police are still on a
 lower moral plane, so to speak, because, in short, the police
 undoubtedly sometimes employ force.  Tolstoy has shown that
 violence merely breeds violence in the person towards whom it is
 used, whereas Love, on the other hand, breeds Love.  So you see
 how I am placed.  I am reduced to use Love in order to stop you.
 I am obliged to use Love."

 He gave to the word an indescribable sound of something hard and
 heavy, as if he were saying "boots".  Turnbull suddenly gripped
 his sword and said, shortly, "I see how you are placed quite
 well, sir.  You will not call the police.  Mr. MacIan, shall we
 engage?"  MacIan plucked his sword out of the grass.
