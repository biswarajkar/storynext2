 "Because I have begun to like you."

 Turnbull's face had a sudden spasm in the sunlight, a change so
 instantaneous that it left no trace behind it; and his features
 seemed still carved into a cold stare.  But when he spoke again he
 seemed like a man who was placidly pretending to misunderstand
 something that he understood perfectly well.

 "Your affection expresses itself in an abrupt form," he began,
 but MacIan broke the brittle and frivolous speech to pieces with
 a violent voice.  "Do not trouble to talk like that," he said.
 "You know what I mean as well as I know it.  Come on and fight, I
 say.  Perhaps you are feeling just as I do."

 Turnbull's face flinched again in the fierce sunlight, but his
 attitude kept its contemptuous ease.
