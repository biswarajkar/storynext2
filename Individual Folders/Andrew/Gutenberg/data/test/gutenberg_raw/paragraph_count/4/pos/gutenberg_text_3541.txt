 MacIan looked at him gravely for a few moments.  "Sir," he said,
 "I ought to say something to you.  I ought to say----"

 "Hush," said Turnbull, suddenly lifting his hand; "be still,
 man."

 In the sudden silence, the drumming of the distant horses grew
 louder and louder with inconceivable rapidity, and the cavalcade
 of police rushed by below them in the lane, almost with the roar
 and rattle of an express train.

 "I ought to tell you," continued MacIan, still staring stolidly
 at the other, "that you are a great chief, and it is good to go
 to war behind you."
