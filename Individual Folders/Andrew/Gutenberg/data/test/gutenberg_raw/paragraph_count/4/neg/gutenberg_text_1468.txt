 As they advanced towards the asylum they looked up at its rows on
 rows of windows, and understood the Master's material threat.  By
 means of that complex but concealed machinery which ran like a
 network of nerves over the whole fabric, there had been shot out
 under every window-ledge rows and rows of polished-steel
 cylinders, the cold miracles of modern gunnery.  They commanded
 the whole garden and the whole country-side, and could have blown
 to pieces an army corps.

 This silent declaration of war had evidently had its complete
 effect.  As MacIan and Turnbull walked steadily but slowly towards
 the entrance hall of the institution, they could see that most,
 or at least many, of the patients had already gathered there as
 well as the staff of doctors and the whole regiment of keepers and
 assistants.  But when they entered the lamp-lit hall, and the high
 iron door was clashed to and locked behind them, yet a new
 amazement leapt into their eyes, and the stalwart Turnbull almost
 fell.  For he saw a sight which was indeed, as MacIan had
 said--either the Day of Judgement or a dream.

 Within a few feet of him at one corner of the square of standing
 people stood the girl he had known in Jersey, Madeleine Durand.
 She looked straight at him with a steady smile which lit up the
 scene of darkness and unreason like the light of some honest
 fireside.  Her square face and throat were thrown back, as her
 habit was, and there was something almost sleepy in the geniality
 of her eyes.  He saw her first, and for a few seconds saw her
 only; then the outer edge of his eyesight took in all the other
 staring faces, and he saw all the faces he had ever seen for
 weeks and months past.  There was the Tolstoyan in Jaeger flannel,
 with the yellow beard that went backward and the foolish nose and
 eyes that went forward, with the curiosity of a crank.  He was
 talking eagerly to Mr. Gordon, the corpulent Jew shopkeeper whom
 they had once gagged in his own shop.  There was the tipsy old
 Hertfordshire rustic; he was talking energetically to himself.
 There was not only Mr. Vane the magistrate, but the clerk of Mr.
 Vane, the magistrate.  There was not only Miss Drake of the
 motor-car, but also Miss Drake's chauffeur.  Nothing wild or
 unfamiliar could have produced upon Turnbull such a nightmare
 impression as that ring of familiar faces.  Yet he had one
 intellectual shock which was greater than all the others.  He
 stepped impulsively forward towards Madeleine, and then wavered
 with a kind of wild humility.  As he did so he caught sight of
 another square face behind Madeleine's, a face with long grey
 whiskers and an austere stare.  It was old Durand, the girls'
 father; and when Turnbull saw him he saw the last and worst
 marvel of that monstrous night.  He remembered Durand; he
 remembered his monotonous, everlasting lucidity, his stupefyingly
 sensible views of everything, his colossal contentment with
 truisms merely because they were true.  "Confound it all!" cried
 Turnbull to himself, "if _he_ is in the asylum, there can't be
 anyone outside."  He drew nearer to Madeleine, but still
 doubtfully and all the more so because she still smiled at him.
 MacIan had already gone across to Beatrice with an air of fright.
