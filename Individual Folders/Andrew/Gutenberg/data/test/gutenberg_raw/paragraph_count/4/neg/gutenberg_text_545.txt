 "With this enormous difference," said Turnbull, "that however
 elaborate be the calculations of physical science, their net
 result can be tested.  Granted that it took millions of books I
 never read and millions of men I never heard of to discover the
 electric light.  Still I can see the electric light.  But I cannot
 see the supreme virtue which is the result of all your theologies
 and sacraments."

 "Catholic virtue is often invisible because it is the normal,"
 answered MacIan.  "Christianity is always out of fashion because
 it is always sane; and all fashions are mild insanities.  When
 Italy is mad on art the Church seems too Puritanical; when
 England is mad on Puritanism the Church seems too artistic.  When
 you quarrel with us now you class us with kingship and despotism;
 but when you quarrelled with us first it was because we would not
 accept the divine despotism of Henry VIII.  The Church always
 seems to be behind the times, when it is really beyond the times;
 it is waiting till the last fad shall have seen its last summer.
 It keeps the key of a permanent virtue."

 "Oh, I have heard all that!" said Turnbull with genial contempt.
 "I have heard that Christianity keeps the key of virtue, and that
 if you read Tom Paine you will cut your throat at Monte Carlo.  It
 is such rubbish that I am not even angry at it.  You say that
 Christianity is the prop of morals; but what more do you do?  When
 a doctor attends you and could poison you with a pinch of salt,
 do you ask whether he is a Christian?  You ask whether he is a
 gentleman, whether he is an M.D.--anything but that.  When a
 soldier enlists to die for his country or disgrace it, do you ask
 whether he is a Christian?  You are more likely to ask whether he
 is Oxford or Cambridge at the boat race.  If you think your creed
 essential to morals why do you not make it a test for these
 things?"

 "We once did make it a test for these things," said MacIan
 smiling, "and then you told us that we were imposing by force a
 faith unsupported by argument.  It seems rather hard that having
 first been told that our creed must be false because we did use
 tests, we should now be told that it must be false because we
 don't.  But I notice that most anti-Christian arguments are in the
 same inconsistent style."
