 "This will do us best, Mr. MacIan," said he.  Then he made a
 gesture towards the heavy stone figure on the pedestal which had
 now its blank and shapeless back turned towards them.  "Don't you
 be afraid," he added, "he can still see us."

 MacIan turned his blue, blinking eyes, which seemed still misty
 with sleep (or sleeplessness) towards the idol, but his brows
 drew together.

 The little man with the long hair also had his eyes on the back
 view of the god.  His eyes were at once liquid and burning, and he
 rubbed his hands slowly against each other.

 "Do you know," he said, "I think he can see us better this way.
 I often think that this blank thing is his real face, watching,
 though it cannot be watched.  He! he!  Yes, I think he looks nice
 from behind.  He looks more cruel from behind, don't you think?"
