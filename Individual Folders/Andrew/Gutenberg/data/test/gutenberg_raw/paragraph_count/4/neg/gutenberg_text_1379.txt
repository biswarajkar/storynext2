 "But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore
 why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_?
 It ought to be no recommendation to _you_.  It is encouraging people
 to marry if you make so much of them."

 "No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would
 always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride,
 especially, is never to be neglected.  More is avowedly due to _her_.
 A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company,
 let the others be who they may."

 "Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know
 what is.  And I should never have expected you to be lending your
 sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies."

 "My dear, you do not understand me.  This is a
 matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,
 and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry."
