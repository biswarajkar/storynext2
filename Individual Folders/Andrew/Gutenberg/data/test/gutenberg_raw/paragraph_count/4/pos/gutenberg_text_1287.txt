 "Yes; my father is to join me here:  we shall walk back together,
 and I must be off immediately.  I am almost afraid that every moment

 "Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and
 Miss Bates?  How unlucky!  Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind

 "Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better.
 It was a right thing to do.  I went in for three minutes, and was
 detained by Miss Bates's being absent.  She was out; and I felt it
 impossible not to wait till she came in.  She is a woman that one may,
 that one _must_ laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.
 It was better to pay my visit, then"--

 He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.
