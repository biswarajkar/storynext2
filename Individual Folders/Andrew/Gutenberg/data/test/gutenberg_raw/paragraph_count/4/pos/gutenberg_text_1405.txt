 Turnbull walked away, wildly trying to explain to himself the
 presence of two personal acquaintances so different as Vane and
 the girl.  As he skirted a low hedge of laurel, an enormously tall
 young man leapt over it, stood in front of him, and almost fell
 on his neck as if seeking to embrace him.

 "Don't you know me?" almost sobbed the young man, who was in the
 highest spirits.  "Ain't I written on your heart, old boy?  I say,
 what did you do with my yacht?"

 "Take your arms off my neck," said Turnbull, irritably.  "Are you
 mad?"

 The young man sat down on the gravel path and went into ecstasies
 of laughter.  "No, that's just the fun of it--I'm not mad," he
 replied.  "They've shut me up in this place, and I'm not mad."  And
 he went off again into mirth as innocent as wedding-bells.
