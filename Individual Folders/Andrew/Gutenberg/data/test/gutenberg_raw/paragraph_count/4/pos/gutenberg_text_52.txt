 In the confused colour and music of his new paradise, Michael
 heard only in a faint and distant fashion some remarks that this
 beautiful solid man seemed to be making to him; remarks about
 something or other being after hours and against orders.  He also
 seemed to be asking how Michael "got up" there.  This beautiful
 man evidently felt as Michael did that the earth was a star and
 was set in heaven.

 At length Michael sated himself with the mere sensual music of
 the voice of the man in buttons.  He began to listen to what he
 said, and even to make some attempt at answering a question which
 appeared to have been put several times and was now put with some
 excess of emphasis.  Michael realized that the image of God in
 nickel buttons was asking him how he had come there.  He said that
 he had come in Lucifer's ship.  On his giving this answer the
 demeanour of the image of God underwent a remarkable change.  From
 addressing Michael gruffly, as if he were a malefactor, he began
 suddenly to speak to him with a sort of eager and feverish
 amiability as if he were a child.  He seemed particularly anxious
 to coax him away from the balustrade.  He led him by the arm
 towards a door leading into the building itself, soothing him all
 the time.  He gave what even Michael (slight as was his knowledge
 of the world) felt to be an improbable account of the sumptuous
 pleasures and varied advantages awaiting him downstairs.  Michael
 followed him, however, if only out of politeness, down an
 apparently interminable spiral of staircase.  At one point a door
 opened.  Michael stepped through it, and the unaccountable man in
 buttons leapt after him and pinioned him where he stood.  But he
 only wished to stand; to stand and stare.  He had stepped as it
 were into another infinity, out under the dome of another heaven.
 But this was a dome of heaven made by man.  The gold and green and
 crimson of its sunset were not in the shapeless clouds but in
 shapes of cherubim and seraphim, awful human shapes with a
 passionate plumage.  Its stars were not above but far below, like
 fallen stars still in unbroken constellations; the dome itself
 was full of darkness.  And far below, lower even than the lights,
 could be seen creeping or motionless, great black masses of men.
 The tongue of a terrible organ seemed to shake the very air in
 the whole void; and through it there came up to Michael the sound
 of a tongue more terrible; the dreadful everlasting voice of man,
 calling to his gods from the beginning to the end of the world.
 Michael felt almost as if he were a god, and all the voices were
 hurled at him.

 "No, the pretty things aren't here," said the demi-god in
 buttons, caressingly.  "The pretty things are downstairs.  You
 come along with me.  There's something that will surprise you
 downstairs; something you want very much to see."

 Evidently the man in buttons did not feel like a god, so Michael
 made no attempt to explain his feelings to him, but followed him
 meekly enough down the trail of the serpentine staircase.  He had
 no notion where or at what level he was.  He was still full of the
 cold splendour of space, and of what a French writer has
 brilliantly named the "vertigo of the infinite," when another
 door opened, and with a shock indescribable he found himself on
 the familiar level, in a street full of faces, with the houses
 and even the lamp-posts above his head.  He felt suddenly happy
 and suddenly indescribably small.  He fancied he had been changed
 into a child again; his eyes sought the pavement seriously as
 children's do, as if it were a thing with which something
 satisfactory could be done.  He felt the full warmth of that
 pleasure from which the proud shut themselves out; the pleasure
 which not only goes with humiliation, but which almost is
 humiliation.  Men who have escaped death by a hair have it, and
 men whose love is returned by a woman unexpectedly, and men whose
 sins are forgiven them.  Everything his eye fell on it feasted on,
 not aesthetically, but with a plain, jolly appetite as of a boy
 eating buns.  He relished the squareness of the houses; he liked
 their clean angles as if he had just cut them with a knife.  The
 lit squares of the shop windows excited him as the young are
 excited by the lit stage of some promising pantomime.  He
 happened to see in one shop which projected with a bulging
 bravery on to the pavement some square tins of potted meat, and
 it seemed like a hint of a hundred hilarious high teas in a
 hundred streets of the world.  He was, perhaps, the happiest of
 all the children of men.  For in that unendurable instant when he
 hung, half slipping, to the ball of St. Paul's, the whole
 universe had been destroyed and re-created.
