 an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually
 large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.

 'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse
 growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'

 'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get
 an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of
 what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
 twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'

 'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'
