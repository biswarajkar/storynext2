 He had time only to say,

 "No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls," when the door
 was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.
 Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to
 give quickest.  Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment,
 and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him.

 "Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning?  My dear Miss Woodhouse--
 I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!
 You are too bountiful!  Have you heard the news?  Mr. Elton is going
 to be married."

 Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was
 so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start,
 and a little blush, at the sound.
