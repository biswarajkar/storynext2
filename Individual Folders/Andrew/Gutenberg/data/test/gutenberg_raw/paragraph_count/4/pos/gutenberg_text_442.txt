 The little man plunged like a rabbit among the tall flowers, the
 two duellists after him.  Turnbull kept at his tail with savage
 ecstasy, still shooing him like a cat.  But MacIan, as he ran past
 the South Sea idol, paused an instant to spring upon its
 pedestal.  For five seconds he strained against the inert mass.
 Then it stirred; and he sent it over with a great crash among the
 flowers, that engulfed it altogether.  Then he went bounding after
 the runaway.

 In the energy of his alarm the ex-Fellow of Magdalen managed to
 leap the paling of his garden.  The two pursuers went over it
 after him like flying birds.  He fled frantically down a long lane
 with his two terrors on his trail till he came to a gap in the
 hedge and went across a steep meadow like the wind.  The two
 Scotchmen, as they ran, kept up a cheery bellowing and waved
 their swords.  Up three slanting meadows, down four slanting
 meadows on the other side, across another road, across a heath of
 snapping bracken, through a wood, across another road, and to the
 brink of a big pool, they pursued the flying philosopher.  But
 when he came to the pool his pace was so precipitate that he
 could not stop it, and with a kind of lurching stagger, he fell
 splash into the greasy water.  Getting dripping to his feet, with
 the water up to his knees, the worshipper of force and victory
 waded disconsolately to the other side and drew himself on to the
 bank.  And Turnbull sat down on the grass and went off into
 reverberations of laughter.  A second afterwards the most
 extraordinary grimaces were seen to distort the stiff face of
 MacIan, and unholy sounds came from within.  He had never
 practised laughing, and it hurt him very much.

 At about half past one, under a strong blue sky, Turnbull got up
 out of the grass and fern in which he had been lying, and his
 still intermittent laughter ended in a kind of yawn.
