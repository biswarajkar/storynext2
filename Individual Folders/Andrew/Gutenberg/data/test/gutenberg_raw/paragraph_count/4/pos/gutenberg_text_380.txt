 "Come out," screamed the little man with the stick.

 "Certainly," said Turnbull, and went outside with the sword,
 MacIan following.

 Seen more fully, with the evening light on his face, the strange
 man looked a little less like a goblin.  He wore a square
 pale-grey jacket suit, on which the grey butterfly tie was the
 only indisputable touch of affectation.  Against the great sunset
 his figure had looked merely small: seen in a more equal light it
 looked tolerably compact and shapely.  His reddish-brown hair,
 combed into two great curls, looked like the long, slow curling
 hair of the women in some pre-Raphaelite pictures.  But within
 this feminine frame of hair his face was unexpectedly impudent,
 like a monkey's.

 "What are you doing here?" he said, in a sharp small voice.
