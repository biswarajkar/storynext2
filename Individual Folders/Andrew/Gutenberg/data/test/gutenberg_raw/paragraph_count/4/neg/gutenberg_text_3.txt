 There was, however, another man on board, so to speak, at the
 time.  Him, also, by a curious coincidence, the professor had not
 invented, and him he had not even very greatly improved, though
 he had fished him up with a lasso out of his own back garden, in
 Western Bulgaria, with the pure object of improving him.  He was
 an exceedingly holy man, almost entirely covered with white hair.
 You could see nothing but his eyes, and he seemed to talk with
 them.  A monk of immense learning and acute intellect he had made
 himself happy in a little stone hut and a little stony garden in
 the Balkans, chiefly by writing the most crushing refutations of
 exposures of certain heresies, the last professors of which had
 been burnt (generally by each other) precisely 1,119 years
 previously.  They were really very plausible and thoughtful
 heresies, and it was really a creditable or even glorious
 circumstance, that the old monk had been intellectual enough to
 detect their fallacy; the only misfortune was that nobody in the
 modern world was intellectual enough even to understand their
 argument.  The old monk, one of whose names was Michael, and the
 other a name quite impossible to remember or repeat in our
 Western civilization, had, however, as I have said, made himself
 quite happy while he was in a mountain hermitage in the society
 of wild animals.  And now that his luck had lifted him above all
 the mountains in the society of a wild physicist, he made himself
 happy still.

 "I have no intention, my good Michael," said Professor Lucifer,
 "of endeavouring to convert you by argument.  The imbecility of
 your traditions can be quite finally exhibited to anybody with
 mere ordinary knowledge of the world, the same kind of knowledge
 which teaches us not to sit in draughts or not to encourage
 friendliness in impecunious people.  It is folly to talk of this
 or that demonstrating the rationalist philosophy.  Everything
 demonstrates it.  Rubbing shoulders with men of all kinds----"

 "You will forgive me," said the monk, meekly from under loads of
 white beard, "but I fear I do not understand; was it in order
 that I might rub my shoulder against men of all kinds that you
 put me inside this thing?"

 "An entertaining retort, in the narrow and deductive manner of
 the Middle Ages," replied the Professor, calmly, "but even upon
 your own basis I will illustrate my point.  We are up in the sky.
 In your religion and all the religions, as far as I know (and I
 know everything), the sky is made the symbol of everything that
 is sacred and merciful.  Well, now you are in the sky, you know
 better.  Phrase it how you like, twist it how you like, you know
 that you know better.  You know what are a man's real feelings
 about the heavens, when he finds himself alone in the heavens,
 surrounded by the heavens.  You know the truth, and the truth is
 this.  The heavens are evil, the sky is evil, the stars are evil.
 This mere space, this mere quantity, terrifies a man more than
 tigers or the terrible plague.  You know that since our science
 has spoken, the bottom has fallen out of the Universe.  Now,
 heaven is the hopeless thing, more hopeless than any hell.  Now,
 if there be any comfort for all your miserable progeny of morbid
 apes, it must be in the earth, underneath you, under the roots of
 the grass, in the place where hell was of old.  The fiery crypts,
 the lurid cellars of the underworld, to which you once condemned
 the wicked, are hideous enough, but at least they are more homely
 than the heaven in which we ride.  And the time will come when you
 will all hide in them, to escape the horror of the stars."
