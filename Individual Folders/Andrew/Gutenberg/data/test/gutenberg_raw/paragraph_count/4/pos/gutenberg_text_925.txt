 "I understood that this garden----" began the bewildered MacIan.

 "Quite so!  Quite so!" said the man on one leg, nodding gravely.
 "I said this garden belonged to me and the land outside it.  So
 they do.  So does the country beyond that and the sea beyond that
 and all the rest of the earth.  So does the moon.  So do the sun
 and stars."  And he added, with a smile of apology: "You see, I'm
 God."

 Turnbull and MacIan looked at him for one moment with a sort of
 notion that perhaps he was not too old to be merely playing the
 fool.  But after staring steadily for an instant Turnbull saw the
 hard and horrible earnestness in the man's eyes behind all his
 empty animation.  Then Turnbull looked very gravely at the strict
 gravel walls and the gay flower-beds and the long rectangular
 red-brick building, which the mist had left evident beyond them.
 Then he looked at MacIan.

 Almost at the same moment another man came walking quickly round
 the regal clump of rhododendrons.  He had the look of a prosperous
 banker, wore a good tall silk hat, was almost stout enough to
 burst the buttons of a fine frock-coat; but he was talking to
 himself, and one of his elbows had a singular outward jerk as he
 went by.
