 "I can never think of it," she cried, "without extreme shame."

 "The shame," he answered, "is all mine, or ought to be.  But is it

 "I never had the smallest, I assure you."

 "That appears quite wonderful.  I was once very near--and I wish I had--
 it would have been better.  But though I was always doing wrong things,
 they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--
 It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond
 of secrecy and told you every thing."
