 "Be silent! or I shall say it all wrong," said MacIan, breathing
 hard.  "It's hard to explain, anyhow.  An apocalypse is the
 opposite of a dream.  A dream is falser than the outer life.  But
 the end of the world is more actual than the world it ends.  I
 don't say this is really the end of the world, but it's something
 like that--it's the end of something.  All the people are crowding
 into one corner.  Everything is coming to a point."

 "What is the point?" asked Turnbull.

 "I can't see it," said Evan; "it is too large and plain."

 Then after a silence he said: "I can't see it--and yet I will try
 to describe it.  Turnbull, three days ago I saw quite suddenly
 that our duel was not right after all."
