 "He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,"
 interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--"much less, perhaps,
 than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve
 on the subject."

 "Emma, my dear Emma--"

 "Oh!" she cried with more thorough gaiety, "if you fancy your
 brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in
 the secret, and hear his opinion.  Depend upon it, he will be much
 farther from doing _you_ justice.  He will think all the happiness,
 all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit
 on mine.  I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him at once.--
 His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."

 "Ah!" he cried, "I wish your father might be half as easily convinced
 as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,
 to be happy together.  I am amused by one part of John's letter--
 did you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take
 him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing
 something of the kind."
