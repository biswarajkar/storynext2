 The conversation was here interrupted.  They were called on to share
 in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses,
 and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when
 the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed
 exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored,
 Emma said,

 "The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me.  I wanted to know
 a little more, and this tells me quite enough.  Depend upon it,
 we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon."

 "And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we
 must conclude it to come from the Campbells."

 "No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells.  Miss Fairfax knows it
 is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.
 She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them.
 I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced
 myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business."
