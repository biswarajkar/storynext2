 "What do you mean?" said MacIan, innocently.

 "I mean," said Turnbull, with steady conviction, "that what we
 want is a little diplomacy, and I am going to buy some in a
 shop."

 XI. A SCANDAL IN THE VILLAGE

 In the little hamlet of Haroc, in the Isle of St. Loup, there
 lived a man who--though living under the English flag--was
 absolutely untypical of the French tradition.  He was quite
 unnoticeable, but that was exactly where he was quite himself.  He
 was not even extraordinarily French; but then it is against the
 French tradition to be extraordinarily French.  Ordinary
 Englishmen would only have thought him a little old-fashioned;
 imperialistic Englishmen would really have mistaken him for the
 old John Bull of the caricatures.  He was stout; he was quite
 undistinguished; and he had side-whiskers, worn just a little
 longer than John Bull's.  He was by name Pierre Durand; he was by
 trade a wine merchant; he was by politics a conservative
 republican; he had been brought up a Catholic, had always thought
 and acted as an agnostic, and was very mildly returning to the
 Church in his later years.  He had a genius (if one can even use
 so wild a word in connexion with so tame a person) a genius for
 saying the conventional thing on every conceivable subject; or
 rather what we in England would call the conventional thing.  For
 it was not convention with him, but solid and manly conviction.
 Convention implies cant or affectation, and he had not the
 faintest smell of either.  He was simply an ordinary citizen with
 ordinary views; and if you had told him so he would have taken it
 as an ordinary compliment.  If you had asked him about women, he
 would have said that one must preserve their domesticity and
 decorum; he would have used the stalest words, but he would have
 in reserve the strongest arguments.  If you had asked him about
 government, he would have said that all citizens were free and
 equal, but he would have meant what he said.  If you had asked him
 about education, he would have said that the young must be
 trained up in habits of industry and of respect for their
 parents.  Still he would have set them the example of industry,
 and he would have been one of the parents whom they could
 respect.  A state of mind so hopelessly central is depressing to
 the English instinct.  But then in England a man announcing these
 platitudes is generally a fool and a frightened fool, announcing
 them out of mere social servility.  But Durand was anything but a
 fool; he had read all the eighteenth century, and could have
 defended his platitudes round every angle of eighteenth-century
 argument.  And certainly he was anything but a coward: swollen and
 sedentary as he was, he could have hit any man back who touched
 him with the instant violence of an automatic machine; and dying
 in a uniform would have seemed to him only the sort of thing that
 sometimes happens.  I am afraid it is impossible to explain this
 monster amid the exaggerative sects and the eccentric clubs of my
 country.  He was merely a man.
