 Emma had hardly expected them:  for Mr. Weston, who had called in
 for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome,
 knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize
 to her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together,
 arm in arm.  She was wanting to see him again, and especially
 to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom
 her opinion of him was to depend.  If he were deficient there,
 nothing should make amends for it.  But on seeing them together,
 she became perfectly satisfied.  It was not merely in fine words
 or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be
 more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her--nothing could
 more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and
 securing her affection.  And there was time enough for Emma to form a
 reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.
 They were all three walking about together for an hour or two--
 first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.
 He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently
 for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on,
 confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village,
 and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma
 could have supposed.
