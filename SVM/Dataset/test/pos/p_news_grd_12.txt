No one can remember exactly how, 10 years ago, we came to start the graphic short story prize. Naturally, I would love to take the credit. But in truth, the idea must have come originally from Dan Franklin of Jonathan Cape, publisher of the UK’s most prominent list of graphic novels.

In 2007, comics were finally beginning to take off in Britain: the animated film of Marjane Satrapi’s memoir Persepolis was just about to be released; Guy Delisle’s travelogue, Burma Chronicles, and Rutu Modan’s novel Exit Wounds, set in Tel Aviv during a period of bomb attacks, had both been critical hits.

Nevertheless, much of the best work still came either from the US, or from France, where bandes dessinees were – and are – such a big deal (the Angoulême international comics festival, attended by 200,000 people every year, has been running since 1974). Franklin’s proposition was that the Observer New Review and Cape would work together to establish a competition to find new British talent. Not too long after this, having secured further support from Comica, the comics festival run by Paul Gravett, we began.

It was clear immediately that our idea had worked: dozens of brilliant but hitherto unpublished cartoonists had been inspired to produce for our delectation some seriously good work (we usually receive around 250 entries). In the years since, we have discovered some remarkable talents, several of whom have gone on to secure publishing deals. Isabel Greenberg, Fumio Obata, Joff Winterhart… the list goes on (and two of the three I’ve just mentioned were, incredibly, only runners-up).

Which brings me to 2017. Our guest judges this year were Stephen The Gigantic Beard That Was Evil Collins, a former winner of the prize, and Philip Pullman, the acclaimed novelist (and the author of the comic book, The Adventures of John Blake). Heartfelt thanks to them both.

As always, we read some great stories. In the end, though, it was If You’re So Wise, , a children’s book illustrator, that stood out – because who doesn’t remember, as a child, being nagged to do their piano practice/homework/revision? (Freeman’s story, in which a portrait of Frida Kahlo and a bust of Beethoven have speaking roles, is – topically – about expertise and the effort it involves.)
