At least eight people in New York City died and 12 were injured after a driver rammed into cyclists and pedestrians before being shot by police, on Tuesday. 
According to police officials, a 29-year-old man drove a pick-up truck into a cycle lane in Manhattan shortly after 3:00pm (19:00 GMT), subsequently hitting a number of people on the route. 

The driver had reached speeds of around 60mph (100km/h) before hitting a school bus. After the collision, the driver exited the vehicle brandishing two imitation guns, at which point he was shot by a police officer. Videos taken by passersby show emergency services treating those wounded with at least two people seen lying on the ground unconscious.
Where did it happen?
The attack happened not far from the World Trade Center.

NYPD Commissioner John Miller said that Saipov is a legal, permanent US resident, who arrived in the country from Uzbekistan in 2010. The suspect was wounded in the abdomen and transferred to a local hospital, police said. He had rented the pick-up from a Home Depot hardware store in New Jersey. 

On Wednesday, Saipov was charged with providing materials and resources to ISIL, as well as violence and destruction of a motor vehicle. Investigators told federal prosecutors that Saipov began planning the attack about a year ago and he wanted to "inflict the maximum damage against civilians". Investigators also said he was inspired by videos posted by ISIL. "In particular, Saipov was motivated to commit the attack after viewing a video in which [ISIL leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ... questioned what Muslims in the United States and elsewhere were doing to respond to the killing of Muslims in Iraq," court documents said. The complaint also said that during Saipov's interview with police, he requested that ISIL's flag be displayed in his hospital room. Saipov appeared in court later on Wednesday in a wheelchair. He was ordered detained and did not enter a guilty plea or seek bail, according to the Associated Press. 
Authorities from the mayor's office to the US Department of Homeland Security swiftly branded the attack as an "act of terrorism".

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stressed that the suspect was believed to have acted alone.
