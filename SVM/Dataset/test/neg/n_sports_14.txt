Dwight Howard fined $25,000 for obscene gesture toward a fan

Dwight Howard still hears it from fans everywhere he goes.

In Minnesota, he let it get to him and made, how shall we put this… an impolite gesticulation toward one of those fans. Now it’s going to cost him.

The NBA announced it has fined Howard $25,000 for an “obscene gesture toward a fan.” There is not a quality video of this, but here you go if you care.

Howard has played well for the Hornets this year, filling the defensive and rebounding role they need, averaging 14.6 points and 13.6 rebounds a contest. The Charlotte defense is 4.2 points per 100 possessions better when Howard is on the court, and when Howard and point guard Kemba Walker are paired Charlotte is outscoring teams by 10.4 points per 100.
