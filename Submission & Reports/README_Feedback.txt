(1) What and How you addressed the feedback your team got for the presentation 
Feedback Received: "Evaluation (including what are training and test data) needs to be better described in the report. What are the predictions on? Sentence-level and document-level?"

To address the confusion, we created an "Evaluation" section in each and every technique we worked with in the project and described the test/training for each of the techniques. Each section has detailed metrics and(or) output/graphs to illustrate evaluation clearly. We also added our UI results in some models to make things more clear.

(2) What changes your team made after the presentation
We did not make any substantial code changes after the presentation, however, we did try to integrate our UI ideas with the Code over the past week. The UI for the project resides in the foler 'web' and is still work in progress as we were improving on the UI representation on an ongoing basis.

Please note that, however, we have completed all the NLP code as per our project milestone we planned to deliver as per what we presented.
