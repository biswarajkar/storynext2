Namvula Rennie is a cool, thoughtful singer-songwriter whose distinctive fusion style reflects her history. Born in Zambia, with a Zambian mother and Scottish father, she lived in Kenya, Switzerland and the US before settling in London, while taking regular trips back to Africa. Her second album shows how she has developed as a confident, soulful performer who can switch effortessly between from African and European influences. So Nalile (Little Sorrow) starts as a Zambian traditional lament before moving to a melody inspired by Nina Simone, while Zuba begins as a breathy acoustic ballad with echoes of Souad Massi, then develops into a robust workout with classy backing provided by members of Led Bib (with producer Liran Donin on bass) and Baaba Maalâ€™s percussionist Mamadou Sarr. Namvula sings in a bewildering variety of languages, and the lyrics and translations are worth checking out online.
