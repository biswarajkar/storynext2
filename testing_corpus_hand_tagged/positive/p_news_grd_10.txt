Few great musicians of the 20th century crossed more musical boundaries, or managed to engage a more diverse audience, than Leonard Bernstein. For five decades he was an irresistible force in American music, as a composer whose extraordinarily varied list of works included perhaps the greatest of all musicals; a conductor of international stature whose multiple achievements included a major role in the recognition of the greatness of Gustav Mahler’s symphonies; and as a tireless musical educator, whose television lectures remain as original and perceptive today as they were when first screened half a century ago.
he centenary of Bernstein’s birth does not fall until next August, but in London the tributes to this larger-than-life genius have already begun, with the London Symphony Orchestra leading the way. The ensemble that Bernstein conducted more than any other in the UK, and whose president he became in 1987, kicked things off with a pair of concerts under his one-time assistant, Marin Alsop.

The LSO’s tribute centres on Bernstein’s three symphonies. Alsop programmed two of them, the First and the Third, the Jeremiah and Kaddish, alongside works by Mahler, while next month, Simon Rattle conducts the Second, The Age of Anxiety, together with the concert version of the musical Wonderful Town. The symphonies make a fascinating choice for such a tribute: perhaps more than any other group of Bernstein’s works, they demonstrate very eloquently both how difficult it is to pigeonhole Bernstein as a composer and his ability to move effortlessly between musical worlds.
Despite the generic title, there’s nothing conventional about any of Bernstein’s symphonies. As their subtitles signal, all three are programmatic pieces of one kind or another. There are no large-scale abstract musical arguments here. The Second, The Age of Anxiety, is not only based on WH Auden’s book-length poem of the same name, but is as much a piano concerto as it is a symphony, while the two that Alsop conducted are embedded in Bernstein’s Jewish heritage and his ambiguous feelings about religious faith.

In many respects, the First, Jeremiah, premiered in 1944, has obvious connections with neoclassical symphonies being written in the US at the time by such composers as Roy Harris and William Schuman, especially in the taut, churning first movement and the scherzo that follows. Both those movements however carry explicit titles – Prophecy and Profanation – and the third and last, Lamentation, is a setting for mezzo-soprano (Jamie Barton, in magnificently imposing voice, in Alsop’s performance) of anguished verses from the Old Testament. An intensely personal musical statement is packaged in what is perhaps the most public of all orchestral forms.

First performed in 1964, the Third Symphony, Kaddish, is a very different beast, though still profoundly personal, still confessional. Its four movements more or less follow a symphonic outline, but are played without a break which characteristically blurs the boundaries of traditional forms. A speaker (Claire Bloom here) delivers a text written by Bernstein, which touches on many of the personal issues with which he wrestled, not least his attitude to Judaism, while the choir (the London Symphony Chorus) provides the backdrop and then comes to the forefront for settings of the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. The centrepiece is an entrancing lullaby by a solo soprano (Laura Claycomb) that seems to occupy a different musical space altogether.
