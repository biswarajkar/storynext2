The Houston Astros refused to quit in Game 2 of the World Series, repeatedly rallying and scoring six runs from the eighth inning forward in a wild, 7-6 extra-innings victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers that evened the World Series at one game apiece.

The heroes were plentiful for the Astros, with Marwin Gonzalez homering to tie the game in the 9th, Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa hitting solo home runs in the 10th to put Houston ahead briefly, and George Springer hitting a two-run homer in the 11th that put them on top to stay.

The Dodgers counterpunched with a dramatic 10th inning in which Yasiel Puig homered and Kike Hernandez briefly tied things with a single, and in the bottom of the 11th they got a surprising home run from Charlie Culberson, but that was all they could muster in a game that stretched on for more than four hours.

In an on-field interview, Correa talked about the confidence the Astros have in their lineup.

“We’re never out of it,” he said. “We have a lineup that’s really scary when it’s on.”

The win came largely as a result of the Dodgers’ aggressiveness with their pitching staff. After starter Rich Hill mostly rolled through four innings, allowing one run while striking out seven, Manager Dave Roberts chose to take him out rather than let him go through Houston’s order a third time. What followed was a parade of eight relievers. The first four took care of business, but Kenley Jansen could not handle a six-out save, giving up a two-run lead, and Josh Fields and Brandon McCarthy each allowed two runs once the game went to extra innings.

Justin Verlander started for Houston, and pitched well in six innings, but he left with his team down and it was the Astros’ bullpen that helped them hold on long enough to let their offense win the game.

The series will now shift to Houston, with Game 3 scheduled for Friday. Yu Darvish is expected to start for the Dodgers with Lance McCullers Jr. on the mound for the Astros.
