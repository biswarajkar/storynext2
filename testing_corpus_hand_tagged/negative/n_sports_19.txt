Bruins fall behind early, lose to Rangers, 4-2

Once again the Bruins had an awful start coming out of the gate on the road, and it again cost them when it was all said and done.

The Bruins gave up three goals in the first period while getting dominated around the front of the net, and ultimately fell by a 4-2 score to the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden after a late comeback attempt.

The loss dropped the Black and Gold to 1-3-1 on the road this season, and continues a string of bad first periods for the Bruins when they hit the road with their injury-depleted, youthful hockey club.

Jimmy Vesey scored a pair of goals to double his season output by camping right in front of the net looking for loose pucks, and Pavel Buchnevich blew past Zdeno Chara for New York's first goal of the game to open things up. David Pastrnak followed the Blueshirts' first goal with a score of his own camped in front just 21 seconds later to tie the score at 1-1, but then Vesey and the hard-hat Rangers got to work grinding in front of the Boston net.

That's the way the score remained until the third period when Patrice Bergeron outmuscled Ryan McDonagh in front for a 50/50 puck, spun and then fired past Henrik Lundqvist to get the Bruins to within one score in the third period. They continued making a push after that, but King Henrik stood tall and stopped 30-of-32 shots en route to the victory for the Rangers in another one-goal game between the two Eastern Conference rivals.

Rick Nash eventually iced it with the empty net goal in the final seconds to hand the Bruins a loss they never really deserved to win at any point.
